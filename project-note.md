Relationship between index, database models, routes, controlers, middlewares:

1. Index has app.use('/api', router) to first receive the API request call from the frontend (client)
2. The request is passed to the router
3. The router parses the request path, method, and payload (in POST method), decides the right endpoint to go to
4. The router endpoint function passes the request to the middleware to verify data, e.g. the login credentials to decide whether to return a reject response or pass on to the right controler function to move forward
5. The controller function deals with the database and return the right response to the frontend through the app.use() Express server function.
   So: server (express().use())--> router--> middleware--> controller-->server

JWT SECRET ENV string can be generated by your OS built-in OpenSSL by running in terminal: openssl rand -base64 64, then use the output string as the secret. You can use use openssl rand -base64 32 which generates a 32 random bytes and base64 encoded string.
